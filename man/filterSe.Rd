\arguments{
\item{object}{A SummarizedExperiment object}

\item{assay}{Assay name to filter on}

\item{sample_col}{Character. Name of the column in the colData that
that corresponds to the assay columns}

\item{group_col}{Character. Either "none" or a columnname in the colData}

\item{not_in}{Character. Either "none" or a value in the group_col.
Specify, if an id should not be present in a group.}

\item{min_abundance}{Numeric. Minimum abundance for a feature to be present
in a sample}

\item{min_pct}{Numeric. Minimum percentage of samples a feature must be
present in. If group_col is specified, the percentage is calculated for
for each group. If min_n is specified, this is ignored, the larger value
will be used.}

\item{min_n}{Integer. Minimum number of samples a feature must be
present in. If group_col is specified, the percentage is calculated for
for each group. If min_pct is specified, this is ignored, the larger value
will be used.}

\item{mz_range}{Numeric. A vector of length 2. The range of kept m/z values.}

\item{rt_range}{Numeric. A vector of length 2. The range of kept rt values.}

\item{id_col}{Character. The respective column name in the rowData.}

\item{rt_col}{Character. The respective column name in the rowData.}

\item{mz_col}{Character. The respective column name in the rowData.}
